# Stock Market Pattern Recognition - Midterm Report

## 📊 Project Overview

This project addresses a core challenge in technical analysis: the **subjective and time-intensive nature of recognizing chart patterns** in stock market data. Traders often rely on manual inspection to identify formations that may indicate either a continuation or a reversal of the current price trend. This process is not only inefficient but also highly inconsistent between analysts.

Our solution is to build a **machine learning model** that automatically detects these patterns from stock market data. By combining programmatic labeling with supervised learning, the model provides a scalable, consistent, and objective tool for technical analysis.

Importantly, this system does not produce direct trading signals. Instead, it generates **flags** or **probabilistic scores** indicating whether a specific chart formation is present. These outputs can then be integrated into larger algorithmic trading frameworks or used as decision-support tools by traders.

## 🔧 Data Processing

### Stock Split Adjustment

One of the most critical preprocessing steps is **detecting and adjusting for stock splits**. Without this adjustment, historical prices would be incomparable across different time periods, making pattern detection unreliable.

**Implementation Details**:
- **Detection Algorithm**: Identifies sudden price drops >30% day-over-day
- **Adjustment Method**: Calculates split ratio and adjusts all historical prices before the split
- **Validation**: Visual comparison of price charts before and after adjustment

Example visualizations:
- `visualizations/stock_analysis/split_detection.png` - Shows detected split events
- `visualizations/stock_analysis/before_after_comparison.png` - Demonstrates impact of adjustment

**Why It Matters**: Stock splits (e.g., 3:1, 4:1) artificially drop prices while maintaining proportional value. If not adjusted, a 50% "drop" that's actually a 2:1 split would trigger false pattern detections.

### Feature Engineering

- **Returns Calculation**: Daily percentage returns (`(close[t] / close[t-1] - 1) × 100`)
- **Volatility Metrics**: Annualized volatility using 252 trading days (`std(daily_returns) × √252`)
- **Moving Averages**: 20-day and 50-day SMA for trend analysis
- **Volume Ratios**: Current volume vs. 20-day average
- **Normalization**: Price indexes set to 100 at start date for comparative analysis

### Data Validation

- Handled missing values and gaps in trading days
- Ensured chronological ordering
- Validated OHLC relationships (High ≥ Low, Close within High/Low range)
- Filtered out invalid data points

## 🎯 Pattern Detection - Cup and Handle (Primary)

### Overview

The **Cup and Handle** pattern is a bullish continuation pattern that consists of:
1. **Cup**: A rounded U-shaped formation representing consolidation
2. **Handle**: A small downward correction after the cup
3. **Breakout**: A confirmed upward breakout with volume

This is the most fully developed component of our project, with **178 patterns** detected across 50 S&P 500 stocks.

**Location**: `patterns/cup-and-handle/cup_and_handle/`

### Algorithm Description

The Cup and Handle detector uses a rule-based approach to systematically identify patterns:

#### 1. Extrema Detection
```python
from scipy.signal import argrelextrema

# Find local peaks and troughs with order=5 for stability
peaks = argrelextrema(price_series, np.greater, order=5)
troughs = argrelextrema(price_series, np.less, order=5)
```

#### 2. Cup Formation Validation
- **Duration**: 7-65 days (ensures realistic formation period)
- **Depth**: 12-33% decline from initial peak (avoids noise, captures real corrections)
- **Shape**: Must be rounded, not V-shaped (uses EMA smoothing)
- **Peak Similarity**: Two peaks must be within ±5% tolerance

**Validation Logic**:
```python
# Check if first peak and second peak are similar in height
peak1_height = data["High"].iloc[first_peak_idx]
peak2_height = data["High"].iloc[second_peak_idx]
difference_pct = abs(peak2_height - peak1_height) / peak1_height * 100

if difference_pct <= 5.0:  # ±5% tolerance
    # Proceed to handle detection
```

#### 3. Handle Detection
- **Duration**: 5-20 days after second peak (quick correction)
- **Depth**: Maximum 15% from second peak (shouldn't retest cup bottom)
- **Position**: Must form in upper half of cup (bullish continuation signal)

#### 4. Breakout Confirmation
- **Price Condition**: Close above resistance level by at least +1%
- **Volume Spike**: Volume on breakout >1.2× 20-day average
- **Confirmation Bar**: Must have both price and volume conditions met

#### 5. Confidence Scoring (0-1 scale)

The algorithm assigns a confidence score based on how well the pattern matches ideal parameters:

```python
def calculate_confidence(cup_depth_pct, handle_depth_pct, 
                         handle_duration, volume_spike):
    """Calculate confidence score based on pattern quality."""
    
    # Cup depth: 12-33% ideal, penalize if outside
    if 12 <= cup_depth_pct <= 33:
        cup_score = 1.0
    elif cup_depth_pct < 12:
        cup_score = cup_depth_pct / 12  # Under-developed
    else:
        cup_score = max(0.0, 1.0 - (cup_depth_pct - 33) / 10)  # Too deep
    
    # Handle depth: 1-15% ideal
    handle_score = min(1.0, handle_depth_pct / 15)
    
    # Duration: 5-20 days ideal
    duration_score = 1.0 if 5 <= handle_duration <= 20 else 0.8
    
    # Volume: Higher spike = more confidence
    volume_score = min(1.0, volume_spike / 2.0)
    
    # Weighted average
    return (0.4 * cup_score + 0.3 * handle_score + 
            0.2 * duration_score + 0.1 * volume_score)
```

## 📉 Pattern Detection - Double Top (Secondary)

### Overview

The **Double Top** pattern is a bearish reversal pattern characterized by:
1. **Two Similar Peaks**: Two local maxima of approximately equal height
2. **Trough Between**: A local minimum (trough) between the peaks
3. **Neckline**: The trough low level acts as support
4. **Breakout Confirmation**: Price breaks below neckline, confirming bearish reversal

**Location**: `patterns/double-top/double-top-algo.py`

### Algorithm Description

The Double Top detector uses a multi-stage filtering approach:

#### 1. Local Extrema Finding

```python
def find_local_extrema(price_series, window=3):
    """Find strict local maxima with window-based filtering."""
    for i in range(window, len(price_series) - window):
        if is_strictly_greater_than_neighbors(price_series, i, window):
            peaks.append(i)
```

#### 2. Peak Pairing (Non-Consecutive)

Unlike simple approaches that only check consecutive peaks, this algorithm **checks all peak pairs** within the valid separation window:

```python
# Check all peak pairs, not just consecutive ones
for i in range(len(peaks)):
    p1 = peaks[i]
    for j in range(i + 1, len(peaks)):
        p2 = peaks[j]
        if min_separation <= (p2 - p1) <= max_separation:
            # Validate as double top candidate
```

**Key Parameters**:
- **Min Separation**: 5 days (avoids noise from adjacent peaks)
- **Max Separation**: 60 days (captures realistic pattern span)
- **Peak Similarity**: Within 5% tolerance of each other

#### 3. Trough Identification

Finds the minimum low between the two peaks:
```python
trough_idx = np.argmin(low_values[peak1+1:peak2])
neckline = low_values[trough_idx]  # Support level
```

**Depth Requirements**:
- Each peak must have dropped at least 2% to reach the trough
- This ensures a meaningful price retracement

#### 4. Uptrend Requirement (Optional)

Before the first peak, there should be an uptrend:
```python
def passes_uptrend(data, peak1_idx, lookback=20, min_return=5.0):
    """Check if there was an uptrend before the pattern."""
    start_idx = max(0, peak1_idx - lookback)
    price_change = (data.iloc[peak1_idx] - data.iloc[start_idx]) / data.iloc[start_idx]
    return price_change * 100 >= min_return
```

#### 5. Breakout Confirmation

Price must break below the neckline to confirm the pattern:

```python
def confirm_break(data, peak2_idx, neckline, lookahead=30):
    """Look forward for a close below neckline."""
    for j in range(peak2_idx + 1, min(peak2_idx + lookahead, len(data))):
        if data['Close'].iloc[j] <= neckline * 0.99:  # 1% margin
            return j  # Confirmation bar index
    return None  # No confirmation
```

#### 6. Volume Filter (Optional)

- **Volume Divergence**: First peak volume > Second peak volume (weakening)
- **Confirmation Spike**: Breakout bar volume > 1.2× 20-day average

### Detection Output

The detector provides comprehensive debug statistics at each filtering stage:

| Stage | Purpose | Typical Reduction |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Peak Similarity | ±5% height tolerance | 60% → 40% candidates |
| Trough Depth | ≥2% drop required | 40% → 25% candidates |
| Uptrend Check | 5% return over 20 days | 25% → 20% candidates |
| Confirmation | Break below neckline within 30 days | 20% → 5-10% patterns |
| Volume Filter | Optional volume requirements | 5-10% → 3-8% final |

### Quality Scoring

Each detected pattern receives a quality score (0-1):

```python
def quality_score(peak_diff_pct, drop1_pct, drop2_pct, confirm_delay):
    """Calculate pattern quality based on key metrics."""
    
    # Peak similarity: smaller difference = better
    similarity = 1.0 - min(peak_diff_pct / 5.0, 1.0)
    
    # Trough depth: deeper is better up to 2x threshold
    depth = min(min(drop1_pct, drop2_pct) / 4.0, 1.0)
    
    # Early confirmation: sooner is better
    early = max(0.0, (30 - confirm_delay) / 30)
    
    return 0.5 * similarity + 0.3 * depth + 0.2 * early
```

## 🔄 Intraday Data Exploration

### Challenge: Limited Daily Patterns

Our initial analysis using **daily OHLCV data** detected 178 Cup and Handle patterns across 50 stocks over 10 years. While this demonstrates proof-of-concept, it's **insufficient for training a robust machine learning model**.

**Issues with Daily Data**:
1. **Temporal Sparsity**: Only ~3.5 patterns per stock over 10 years
2. **Class Imbalance**: ~0.07% of days contain patterns
3. **Limited Training Examples**: With 80/20 train/test split, only ~140 training examples

### Solution: Intraday Minute-Level Data

To address this limitation, we're expanding to **intraday minute-level data** for the following reasons:

1. **Higher Pattern Frequency**: 
   - Daily charts: 1 pattern per ~180 days
   - Minute charts: Many more minor corrections and consolidations
   - Example: What looks like 1 daily bar might contain 390 intraday bars (6.5 hours × 60 min)

2. **Richer Feature Space**:
   - Intraday patterns form faster (hours vs. weeks)
   - More granular feature extraction
   - Better for sequence-based models (LSTM, Transformer)

3. **Scalability**:
   - ~252 trading days/year × 390 minutes/day = **~98,000 data points per stock per year**
   - For the same 10 stocks: **~980,000 training examples**
   - At 0.1% pattern rate: ~**980 patterns** (vs. ~18 daily patterns)

### Data Collection Infrastructure

We've implemented the infrastructure for collecting intraday data:

**File**: `data-collection/fetch_one_minute.py`

**Key Features**:
- Fetches last 365 days of 1-minute OHLCV data from Alpha Vantage
- Automatic API key rotation (25 keys) to handle rate limits
- Supports multiple intervals: 1min, 5min, 15min, 30min, 60min
- Output format: `{TICKER}_minute_{INTERVAL}_365d.csv`

**Limitations**:
- Free tier Alpha Vantage: Last 30 days only (not full 365 days)
- Requires API keys (provided code uses test keys - replace with your own)
- Rate limit: 5 requests/minute per key

**Next Steps**:
- Collect intraday data for top 10-15 stocks
- Apply same pattern detection algorithms
- Generate large labeled dataset for ML training
